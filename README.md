### 🛠 How to Run This Project
If you have cloned this repository, follow these steps to run the game correctly (as the huge `Library` folder is ignored via `.gitignore`):

1.  **Open Unity Hub** and click **Add**.
2.  Select the `HW_2025_Test` folder.
3.  **Open the Project.**
    * *Note:* The first launch may take 2-5 minutes as Unity effectively "rebuilds" the project Library from the Assets. This is normal.
4.  Once open, navigate to the Project window: `Assets` -> `_Scenes`.
5.  Double-click **`SampleScene`** to load the level.
6.  Press the **Play** button at the top!
